This runs on some webserver with php installed. In this case fortune.joschas.page.

You'll need cowsay and fortune. Just run `./installDependencies.sh`

Also make sure to enable .htaccess support in your servers config.

In case you are not on Linux, that's no problem:

- [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)
- [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)
- [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/download/)
